"Development Challenges"

The primary challenge in developing TagPlay was designing adaptive enemy AI that could effectively intercept and compete with the player for dynamic objectives. Achieving responsive and competitive AI behavior required in-depth experimentation with Unreal Engine 5â€™s AI tools and careful C++ coding to ensure that enemy characters react intelligently and dynamically to both the player and the game environment.

"Key Focus Areas"
Significant effort was invested in:

Dynamic Ball Spawning System: Developed a custom spawning mechanism that adjusts in real time to create unpredictable and challenging scenarios, ensuring continuous engagement and balanced difficulty as the player progresses.
AI Behavior Design: Implemented advanced AI routines that allow enemy characters to strategically locate and intercept balls, maintaining a competitive edge that enhances the core gameplay dynamics.
