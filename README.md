# TagGameCode

Development Challenges
The primary challenge in developing TagPlay was designing adaptive enemy AI that could effectively intercept and compete with the player for dynamic objectives. Achieving responsive and competitive AI behavior required in-depth experimentation with Unreal Engine 5â€™s AI tools and careful C++ coding to ensure that enemy characters react intelligently and dynamically to both the player and the game environment.
